<p> This webpage was created for CSC 106 "The joys of Programming" at the University of Rhode Island as part of learning HTML and CSS. <br> 
    This website will include all projects created during this semester including those with Javascript under the section with the same name <br>    
    I hope you enjoy this page even if it is barebones.</p>
